Thank you for completing this <span>entrance task</span> for the Birkbeck courses above.<br />
We are asking you to do this because coding is part of the course and requires practical application and an iterative process of writing code, testing your work and moving forward to develop your skills further. We want to ensure that you:
                </p>
<ul>
 <li>Enjoy coding and find it interesting</li>
 <li>See the importance of coding for your professional and personal development</li>
 <li>Understand the commitment required to improve your skills</li>
 <li>Are motivated to apply yourself to the course fully.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Some further Information</h1>
<ul>
 <li>You will need to work at home in addition to the classroom sessions on the course – at least double the classroom hours</li>
 <li>This is a postgraduate course and independent learning is expected. It’s how you would learn in an industry setting.</li>
 <li>You should be prepared to share your work with tutors and peers to benefit from the feedback available as you progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>   
<i>The course is intensive so if selected we will be asking you to continue to practice up until the start of the course.</i>
<br /><span>Good luck!</span><br />
